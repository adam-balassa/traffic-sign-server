# Traffic signs server

Spring boot server for a traffic sign recognition application

## Requirements
For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 11](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/)
- [Maven 3.6.0](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `hu.bme.aut.TrafficSignsApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
